### Hi, I'm Anel
I'm a C#/.NET software engineer currently learning and transitioning into the web3/blockchain world.

I'm also usually working with or digging into:
* SQL/MS SQL Server
* [ghost](https://ghost.org/) and its frontend tech stack 👻
* Anything GIS! I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) specialist and love using [CARTO](https://CARTO.com) 🌍

#### 📢 Are you a Visual Studio Code user? Make sure to download and review my theme editor, [Miss Dracula](https://bit.ly/missdracula) 🧛🏽‍♀️🦇
